# Quotas

Each access is subject to quotas. Quotas are not precise, but act as a fallback mechanism for run-away usage. Most
quotas are enforced at the Organization level. Once reached, you will start receiving HTTP 429 responses. The provided
clients will automatically back-off and retry at a later time.

## Access types

There are three ways of accessing APIs:

1. **User Token**: Access via website uses AWS Cognito tokens
2. **User API Key**: Access via API Key for users and external services
3. **Task API Key**: Access via API Key auto-created for running tasks

Token access is always subject to the default quota level. API Key access can be raised on request

## Levels of quotas

There are three levels of quotas defined in a table with headers name, description, and limit.:

| Type    | Requests Per Second | Daily limit | Est. Max Price/Month* |
|---------|---------------------|-------------|-----------------------|
| Default | 0.0115              | 1000        | $1.00                 |
| One     | 1                   | 86,400      | $100.00               |
| Ten     | 10                  | 864,000     | $1000.00              |
| Hundred | 100                 | 8,640,000   | $10000.00             |

* This is a fictional estimate, pricing may vary depending on plan, type of request and average compute/storage.
